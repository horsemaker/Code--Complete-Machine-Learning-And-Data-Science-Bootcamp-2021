# Zero to Mastery Machine Learning

Welcome! This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, images and other materials related to the [Zero to Mastery Machine Learning Course on Udemy](https://dbourke.link/mlcourse) and [zerotomastery.io](https://dbourke.link/ZTMmlcourse).


## What this course focuses on

1. Create a framework for working through problems ([6 step machine learning modelling framework](https://github.com/horsemaker/Code--Complete-Machine-Learning-And-Data-Science-Bootcamp-2021/blob/master/section-1-getting-ready-for-machine-learning/README.md))
2. Find tools to fit the framework
3. Targeted practice = use tools and framework steps to work on end-to-end machine learning modelling projects
